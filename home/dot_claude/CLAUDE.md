# User Preferences

## Language
- Respond in Japanese unless the context requires otherwise (e.g., code comments, commit messages in English projects)
- Use English for technical terms and code-related content

## Communication Style
- Be concise and direct
- Skip unnecessary pleasantries and filler phrases
- Prioritize technical accuracy over validation

## Code Style
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever solutions
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Follow existing project conventions when editing files
- Use meaningful variable and function names in English

## Git Workflow
- Commit messages: Use Conventional Commits format
- Keep each commit focused on a single concern; do not mix unrelated changes
- Never force push to main/master without explicit permission

## Safety Rules
- Never create files outside the project directory (e.g., /tmp); keep all files within the project scope
- Never execute destructive commands (rm -rf, dd, mkfs) without confirmation
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Never modify system files or use sudo without explicit request

## When Uncertain
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
- Propose alternatives when multiple valid approaches exist
- Think critically about user requests; point out overlooked considerations or potential issues
